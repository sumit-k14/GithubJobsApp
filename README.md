In this app, we learnt about basic fundamentals pf React Hooks, the project is made of using React Hooks.
For this project we need to install -
(i) npm create-react-app
(ii) npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
(iii) npm install bootstrap
(iv) npm install react-markdown
(v) npm install cors


When you run this project it will show some errors, these errors came because of cors issue. So you need to open inspect [press (shift + ctrl + i)] and after that go to console part where you find the cors issue just click on that link and a new tab will open where you find a request button, press that button and after that refresh your localhost page, your project willwork correctly.
